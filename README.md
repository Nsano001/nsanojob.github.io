        <h3 id="Intro-to-design-and-dev">Introduction to web Design and Development</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">Attending the live session and the online class on web design and development gave me a solid introduction to creating user-friendly, visually appealing websites. I learned about essential components like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are crucial for structuring, styling, and adding interactivity to web pages. The classes also emphasized best practices in responsive design to ensure websites look great on any device, along with a focus on user experience (UX) and accessibility. This hands-on approach allowed me to gain practical skills and a deeper understanding of both the creative and technical aspects of building effective, engaging websites.</p>
        <h3 id="intro-to-design-tools">Introduction to design and design tools</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">The lesson on design and design tools gave me a thorough grounding in essential design principles and practical experience with key tools used in the industry. I gained insights into how elements like balance, contrast, and alignment work together to create visually compelling layouts. I also learned to navigate popular design software like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma, which allowed me to practice digital asset creation, image editing, and layout prototyping. This training has honed both my creative and technical skills, preparing me to craft polished and professional designs effectively.</p>
        <h3 id="intro-to-html-and-css">Introduction to html and css</h3>
        <p class="paragraphs">HTML and CSS are foundational technologies for building and styling web pages. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) structures the content on a page, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the appearance, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design. Together, HTML and CSS enable developers to create visually engaging and accessible web pages, with HTML providing the content framework and CSS adding style and layout. Mastering these languages is essential for anyone looking to create modern, user-friendly websites.</p>
